# PaymentIntegrations

## 💡 Overview

`PaymentIntegrations` is a modular, extensible .NET middleware built to handle integrations with various payment service providers like:

- **Geidea**
- **Paymob**
- **Fawry**

The solution acts as a **bridge** between your system and external payment gateways by unifying the interface and request/response structure, making it easy to plug in new providers with minimal changes.

## 🧱 Architecture

The project is structured using **Clean Architecture principles** for maintainability and scalability:

### 🔧 Layers Breakdown

- **Core**: Defines interfaces, shared models, and contracts (e.g., requests, responses, transactions).
- **Application**: Contains service implementations to handle logic like transforming or routing payment operations.
- **Infrastructure** *(planned)*: Responsible for API communication, SDKs, or low-level operations with providers.

---

## 🔌 Supported Providers

- ✅ **Paymob**
- ✅ **Fawry**
- ⏳ **Geidea** *(in progress)*

You can extend the middleware to support other payment gateways by implementing the standard interfaces.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/PaymentIntegrations.git
cd PaymentIntegrations
```
### 2. Add Configuration
```Configure your keys and provider settings in a secure app settings section or via dependency injection.```

###3. Add a New Provider
```To support a new payment provider:

Implement the following interfaces in the Core.Interfaces layer:

IPaymentConnection

IPaymentRequest

IPaymentResponse

ITransactionService

Create request and response models under Core.Entities.

Add the service logic under Application.Services.

Register the implementation in your DI container.
